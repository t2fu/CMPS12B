All of the files that been submitted:

README
Makefile
Simulation.java
QueueInterface.java
QueueEmptyException.java
Queue.java
QueueTest.java
Job.java


Note: The submitted files implement a Queue ADT in Java based on a linked list data structure. The Simulation.java will use the
Queue ADT to simulate a set of jobs performed by a set of processors, when there are more jobs than processors,
and some jobs will have to wait in a queue until it has open space to preforms the jobs. The Queue.java includes
seven Queue ADT operations implemented by methods. The QueueEmptyException.java define the exception class to be thrown.
The exception class are subclass of the RuntimeException. The QueueTest file is use to thoroughly test each
Queue ADT in isolation. The QueueInterface.java and Job.java are copied and unchangedfrom the codes that provided
on the course webpage. The specific functions of the methods, files, and codes are listed in the comments.
